## WeatherApp

Following tutorial found here http://taco.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/get-started-first-mobile-app/

* The app gets current location as lattude and longitude from Yahoo Weather Api.
* It then coverts the co-ordinates to a Zip Code and enters it into a text input box.
* Next when the Get Weather button is clicked it displays weather data for that area.
